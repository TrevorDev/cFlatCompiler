# cFlatCompiler

A compiler for the Cflat language.

This project builds and runs on Mac OS X and Linux.

Requirements:

- NodeJS (http://nodejs.org)
- graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org)
- a recent yacc/bison (precence support)

To build, simply run make in this directory, and cflatc will be built.

Some C files and headers (nodes.c and nodes.h) get autogenerated from the 
proNode directory.

scanner.l is the lex file responsible for tokenizing the input.

parser.y is the yacc file that dicates the grammar that composes the Cflat
language, and forms the syntax tree. It uses the generated nodes.[ch] files
to do so. 

The .svg tree gets generated from nodes.c functions also.

Run make runtests to run the cflatc compiler against all of testFiles/[1-5].cb
